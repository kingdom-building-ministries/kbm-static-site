*Go with the strength that you have. (Judges 6:14)*

As hundreds of Haitian youth leaders gathered together in Titanyen to worship The Lord and be further equipped to introduce others to the life-changing hope of Jesus, this Scripture was repeated frequently as the theme of the week. It can be so easy to believe the lie that we don't have much to offer the world - that our impact will be too small. But this week we sought to challenge that belief, and to invite others into the knowledge that truly the greatest gift that they can give the world is their intimacy with God; and as they learn to go confidently with the strength they have, they can trust that God is faithful to add the increase.

The  Greek word for "equip" literally means "to mend the nets" - and in this "Equip Haiti" youth leaders conference, that was what we hoped to accomplish. We wanted to help mend the nets of those who will remain here in Haiti, so they can more effectively labor with Jesus as He empowers them to become "fishers of men."

To do this, we provided teaching throughout the week, introducing these young adults to various tools for their own personal growth. We talked to them about prayer, different ways to study the Bible, and how to invest in the Kingdom. We led them in a time of reflection, asking them to write down the ways they have heard God speak or seen Him at work in their lives. For many, this was a completely new experience, and they were encouraged to see and remember God's faithfulness woven throughout their stories. One young woman said "I can't describe how this experience makes me feel, but my heart is racing."

As we taught each of these spiritual disciplines, we also talked about how to pass them to others, so these young adults can take what they've learned this week and bring it home to pass to others, who can pass it to others, and so on: and the Kingdom of heaven can grow in the country of Haiti like a mustard plant, which starts with just a small seed, but grows and spreads and takes over everything.

Most importantly, as we sought to "mend the nets" of the Haitian youth leaders, Adrian Despres challenged them to take a deeper look at what they mean when they say they believe in God - and many were awakened to a deeper understanding of what it means to truly BELIEVE in Jesus with everything they have and everything they are, in a way that changes how they live. 

After being ushered before the throne of heaven day after day, the conference ended with a powerful message proclaiming the true strength we have to go forward with: CHRIST in us, the hope of glory.  

*Christ is in you ... Christ is in you ... Christ is in you.*

This phrase was repeated as we walked around the auditorium, coming up close to each one, touching one another and saying with all the confidence of God's promise that Christ is in us and will be with us.  

Pray for those who attended this conference, as they return home after a week of intense discipleship. Pray that they would remain at the feet of Jesus. Pray that they would remember that Christ is in them. Pray for them to go with the strength they have... and watch God work.
