Isn’t it amazing what some will do in helping people get to Jesus?  The man was paralyzed.  His brain sent the commands, but his muscles, tendons, ligaments, and bones never got the message to crawl, walk, bend, turn, flex, or even twitch. Immobility was his daily mantra.  Even if he wanted to get to Jesus, this miracle worker who he had heard so much about, the odds of doing so were miniscule.  A standing room only crowd, a rising celebrity in great demand, and no special access privileges afforded.  What chance did the motionless man have to encounter the One who could change everything?

We don’t know their names, ages, occupations, or faces.  Perhaps they were friends, maybe neighbors, possibly even relatives.  The writer doesn’t say.  All we know is that there were several of them and four in particular.  Four people—who thought enough about the paralytic man and the power of Jesus to personally invest in getting the two together.  They somehow knew in their spirit that if they could only get this man to Jesus, life-altering things would happen. (Mark 2)

With great effort, they put their faith to work.  They picked the man up, dug the roof out, and lowered the paralyzed man down.  Jesus, moved by the faith of those who had come alongside, met the crippled man at his deepest need and gave him legs to walk in the process.  

Are you one among the “four,” who have been extending love in real ways to bring others up-close to Jesus, the miracle worker?  Your love for others, your trust in Jesus to help others discover a “heart on fire, life on purpose” Kingdom life, and your willingness to put feet to your faith, pleases God and moves His heart to action.  Keep on going!
