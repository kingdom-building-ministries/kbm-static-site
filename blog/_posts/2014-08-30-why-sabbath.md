When God gave the Ten Commandments to the Israelites after the Exodus, He gave a gift.   He gave his people ways to live, ways to enjoy their freedom.  Trust Him first and above all else, He said.  Then, before He gave them the best ways to live with others in community, He said, *“Rest.”*

“Remember to observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.  You have six days for your ordinary work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath day of rest dedicated to the Lord your God.”  (Exodus 20:8-9a, NLT)

He had rescued them from slavery, from no rest, from only work.  Freedom meant learning to trust in the God who had rescued them, to trust His calendar, to trust His gifts.

In modern westernized culture, we have a difficult time balancing recreation and work, too easily tilting to one side or the other.  It is important to note that the other six days of the week are a part of the rhythm of Sabbath.  We have time specifically for working; these are days of being faithful with the work of our hands and of trusting that a rest is coming. 

Sabbath must come.  If it doesn’t, the body, mind, and spirit will retaliate.  We are created for work AND for rest.  In our culture, we are not very comfortable with ceasing our busyness—and not just work busyness, but, more so, the busyness in our heads.  We are not comfortable entering into a stillness where we must sit with ourselves and be okay with ourselves and shut up our noisy brains.  Learning true rest takes discipline, and a bit of courage. 

Sabbath most certainly will include meditating on God’s goodness, his Word, his love.  But it does not have to be specifically “holy duties.”  Being restful—putting aside the regular things—in God’s presence is a holy practice.  Rest for some...

...looks like creating time to clean, then watching *Lord of the Rings*.

...looks like hiking, exploring, and then hanging out in a hammock.

...looks like closing their eyes and sleeping.

...looks like reading all day long.

...is sharing a meal around the table.  

...is setting aside time to grieve.

...is spending an hour, or two, recounting the faithfulness of God. 

...means incorporating music into your Sabbath time.  

...looks like gardening, rock climbing, running, skiing, knitting, painting, coloring...

The list is as broad as the many ways in which God made us wonderfully and fearfully unique.  

Rest.  We are to work hard at the appropriate times, and then we are to stop at appropriate times.  We can trust that rest is for us, that God is for us, that Sabbath--in all its forms--is a gift.
