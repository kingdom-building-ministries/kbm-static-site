**Q:** What faith steps have you taken since *The Experience*?  

**A:** Since *The Experience* the faith steps I've taken have been moving, finding a family willing let me stay with them and accepting an internship position with Colorado Community Church's youth group.  At this moment I feel that steps are being presented in many options and the Lord is asking me over and over, "How much do you trust me?". 

**Q:** What are you excited about in this season?  How do you hope God molds and shapes you?

**A:** This internship will give me the chance to get my feet wet in lots of ministry experiences.  I'm excited about getting to impact the youth in Aurora, CO and for what God will teach me.  It's a joy to just be serving the Kingdom!  I hope God molds, shapes and employs my story to impact more laborers for the kingdom. 

**Q:** What are your prayers over todayâ€™s youth?  What does it look like for the Kingdom of God to come near in the youth group?

**A:** I pray that the youth would have an encounter with God, the One who can change everything.  I hope that they can find positive people in their life that can be an example of what a godly man and woman should look like and be shown a life that gives God all the honor and glory. 

I see the Kingdom of God coming near through training, equipping, and releasing young people into the adventure of living for God's Kingdom. As leaders it is our pleasure, our delight, to be part of that story with them. As Paul said in 1 Thessalonians 2:19, "For what is our hope, our joy, or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes? Is it not you?" Our joy will be the fruit of lives given whole-heartedly to following Christ!
