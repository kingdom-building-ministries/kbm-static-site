Little do we realize that when we end our prayers after only expressing our immediate needs, we diminish the important intercessory role God has given us through prayer.  It is a divine privilege to join in the work God is doing by laboring in prayer for others through intercession.  But laboring, by nature, implies hard work and perseverance...something we easily shy away from.  What would happen if more of God's people were willing to labor (in the full sense of the word) in intercession for people and places beyond themselves?

Andrew Murray writes:

*What unspeakable grace to be allowed to deal with God in intercession for the supply of the needs of others!  What a blessing, in close union with Christ, to take part in His great work as Intercessor, and to mingle my prayers with His!*

*What a privilege, as a steward of the grace of God, to bring to Him the state of the church or of individual souls, of the ministers of the Word or His messengers working among the unsaved, and plead on their behalf until He entrusts the answer!*

*What blessedness, in union with other children of God, to strive together in prayer until the victory is gained over difficulties here on earth, or over the powers of darkness in high places!  May God help us see the place intercession takes in His divine counsel and in His work for the kingdom.*
(God's Best Secrets, The Blessedness of a Life of Intercession)

So, what would happen if we took our role in intercession seriously?  A thought: Perhaps we would find ourselves participating more in the work God is up to.  We often forget that what precedes many Kingdom victories and “God sightings” is intercession.  Prayer will often lead us right into the middle of the work God is up to.  

Do you feel stagnant in your walk with Jesus?  Return to a posture of prayer. Invite God’s transformation within your own heart, ask Him what is on His heart you can pray for, and see what unfolds.  May you understand the importance your intercession has in the advancement of God’s Kingdom.
