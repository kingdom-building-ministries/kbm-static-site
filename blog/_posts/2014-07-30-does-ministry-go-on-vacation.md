Does ministry go on vacation?  To give a resounding “yes” to that question is to compartmentalize one’s life and faith.  Our relationship with Jesus is far more than “a part” of our lives.  Faith and life in him encompasses and permeates every fiber of our being – our thoughts, speech, decisions, emotions, time, giving, serving, playing, and doing.  We dare not treat Jesus in the same manner as work, hobbies, casual friendships, or community volunteering where we can lay them aside for a season or a weekend and then leisurely pick them back up at a time of our own choosing.   As Isaac Watts penned some 300 years ago - the “so amazing, so divine” love that God offers “demands *our* soul, *our* life, *our* all.”

By the same notion, God does call us to rest, recreate, and recuperate.  That’s why he so graciously gave us the gift of Sabbath.  He wants us to know that we are not enslaved, and that we were made for far more than brick-making and bottom-line, nose-to-the-grindstone productivity.  Jesus himself modeled such a life as he often withdrew to out of the way places (Luke 5:16).  But then again, Jesus also healed the sick and fed the poor on the Sabbath, the very day made for rest – and that, much to the chagrin of the religious rule keepers.  So what gives?

It’s this: Jesus allowed his love for the Father and others to saturate every moment of his life.  There was no dividing here and there.  Love was the highest value and trumping factor in every situation, conversation, and encounter.  Love never took a break.  Real love never does.

So vacation away!  But vacation in love.  Realize as you walk on the beach, fish in the lake, hike in the mountains, visit relatives, site see the monuments, or do a whole lot of nothing – that God is *with* you, and his all-encompassing, all-glorious love accompanies you in every along-the-way conversation, gas stop, souvenir purchase, and restaurant meal.  Let God set the travel agenda as you allow love to overflow from your intimacy with him to the people and places of his choosing.
