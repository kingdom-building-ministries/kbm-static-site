In the previous post, <a href="http://www.kbm.org/blog/2014/08/04/deep-values/" target="_blank">Deep Values</a>, we discussed that where Kingdom values are planted and nurtured through an intimate relationship with the King, Kingdom life takes root and makes its way to the surface of everyday life.  The ordinary becomes extraordinary, new colors paint the day and we find ourselves waking up to a story being told that is much bigger than ourselves.  

If someone began capturing the last year of your life in story form, what would it say?  

I think the Christian life is full of "Little did he know..." moments.  Beyond coincidence, the Author of our Salvation has been orchestrating divine opportunities for the advancement of His Kingdom for thousands of years.

Little do we know what God might have in store for His glory as we shuffle out of bed tomorrow and offer our day for His use.  A helping hand of love to the overlooked, a prayer of intercession, an intentional conversation at the lunch table, pouring out what God has poured in, asking forgiveness.  Are you willing to allow each day to be scripted by the Spirit's leading? 

An *Experience* 2014 alumni, Andrew, recently shared a "little did he know" moment with us:

*Earlier tonight I had the opportunity to talk with a missionary from Nigeria, named Phanuel.  My family was having dinner at a friends house and he was also their guest for dinner. When it was time for us to leave I felt the Spirit prompt me to ask him if we could pray with Him. This was awesome because at first I was like "No, it might be weird and my family might think this is strange". Then I thought to myself, this is exactly what we did on the International and Wander Stages, and remembered how God used those times to encourage the entire group. I am glad to say that my family and I did pray for him and he prayed for us too! Be reminded to KNOW and REMEMBER God's signs.*

What moments do you recognize lately that were penned by the Author himself?  “Little did you know moments” come not out of right activity or behavior but out of allowing Kingdom values to be a part of your life in such a way that Kingdom advancement appears in wonderful ways one didn’t plan or was aware of.  Don't lose track of *whose* story you're in!
