*A new command I give you: Love one another.  As I have loved you, so you must love one another.  By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another. (John 13:34-35)* 

Partnering with God.  It sounds great in theory and looks exciting when we watch the men and women we admire.  But what about you and what about me?  You think to yourself, “I’ve tried ... stepping out in faith, building relationships and trying new things ... and honestly, I’m pretty tired of feeling awkward.”  Let me be the first to tell you, you’re not alone.

My husband and I have begun making some new friends in Colorado and leading a 20s and 30s community group through our church.  Exciting, yes!  But here’s the truth, I had forgotten how uncomfortable forming new relationships can be!  *Am I being too friendly?  Did I just offend them?  How much do I share about myself?  They avoided my question, did I go too deep too fast?*  Just an example of the thousand and one different directions my mind can travel during a first conversation.  Can anyone out there relate?

Unfortunately, my last word search through the Bible came up with zero matches for the word “awkward.”  However, there are plenty of instances in Scripture where our use of the term could apply: Adam and Eve’s first conversation after sin entered the world, Noah and his boat in the desert, Joseph and Potiphar’s wife, David and angry King Saul, John the Baptist, Peter slicing that soldier’s ear off and so much more.  It seems that obedience, faith and partnering with God can often bring us face to face with the unknown and the uncomfortable.

Consider this: Is joining God in the work He is up to worth the cost of awkward, unknown and uncomfortable?     

Let’s take it a step further.  Sometimes awkward moments can’t be avoided, however, have you ever paused to think about why it felt awkward in the first place?  At times there are deeper factors at work within us: fear, self-reliance, insecurities and more.  Think about your current activities, opportunities and relationships.  Are any of the pests mentioned above present?  In the next uncomfortable moment you encounter, invite God to join you in it and help you navigate your fears and personal roadblocks.  May freedom in Jesus Christ abound as you gain new perspective.

God delights when we are willing to join Him in His work.  And while the Bible doesn’t give us a formula to solve our awkwardness, it does mention making love the priority, depending on God, relying on the Holy Spirit’s work and power, and a posture that only cares about bringing God glory.  With His help, awkward doesn’t have to be a big deal, for God works far beyond our ability and limitations…and the advancement of His Kingdom is always worth it.

What’s holding you back today from joining God’s work?  Maybe it’s time to finally declare you’re awkward and over it, devoted to the King, complete in your Father’s love and honored to be lovingly “on mission” with God anytime, with anyone, anywhere.
