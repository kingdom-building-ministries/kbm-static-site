When you release a boat out into the ocean, there is no option for it to remain still and unaffected. You can choose to harness the power of the wind with a sail, or to set your strength to rowing, or you can choose to throw down an anchor to remain in one place; and even if you do not choose anything, the waves will push and sweep your boat away. You may or may not get where you were hoping to go, but you can be sure you will be moved. 

Similarly, although you may never have taken the time to think through what you value, what motivates your actions and shapes your decisions, you can be sure that something will always fill that role.  Like the waves of the sea, you will be carried away unless you make an intentional decision to go another direction. 

So the question is: Where are you headed?  And how are you getting there?

“Your beliefs become your thoughts, 
Your thoughts become your words,
Your words become your actions,
Your actions become your habits,
Your habits become your values,
Your values become your destiny.”
-Gandhi

If we can trace our values back to what we *believe*, take some time to ask yourself: do you believe Jesus meant what He said?  

When Jesus said that the most important thing is to “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength” and to “Love your neighbor as yourself” (Mark 12:30-31) and when He said “Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear…But seek first His Kingdom and His righteousness” (Matthew 6:25, 33) – do you believe that He meant what He said? 

And if so, how does that belief shape your life? 

***Ask yourself:***

*What does my life currently reflect that I value most? (Time with loved ones, wealth, prayer, comfort, service, surrender, etc.)*

*What do I want to be said about me when my life is over?* 

*If what I am believing and valuing is not currently leading me toward the legacy I hope for, what needs to change?*
