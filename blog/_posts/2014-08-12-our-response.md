Just looking at a map of the world’s current crises, it’s easy to be overwhelmed. 

West African Ebola Outbreak:
*WHO says it believes the virus has infected 1,848 people and killed 1,013, making this the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history.*

IS Militants in Iraq and Syria: 
*The UN said Isis and its allies had committed "systematic and egregious violations" against civilians, including killings, sexual violence, kidnappings, destruction of property and attacks on places of religious worship.*

Gaza and Israel, Ukrainian rebels, Latin America’s dangerous drug cartels… the list goes on – poverty, hunger, violence, corruption, persecution.

With the frightful headlines of our day, our response as believers is important.  

Oftentimes we feel the need before us is too great for our help to make a difference...if we even knew how to help.  Moreover, ignorance may seem preferable over looking pain and suffering in the eye, and we wash our hands of any responsibility awareness might bring.  The truth is, responding to the unbearable reality, the questions and the incurable circumstances around us doesn’t come easy.  But the world needs Hope and we can point them there.  And when we don’t know what to do, *we can pray*.  

While you engage the current news and conversation, employ your "first responder" ...prayer...asking God to help guide you to intercede in accordance with His heart and His truth.  The emotion felt while interceding might just be gut-wrenching...but will you allow yourself to be uncomfortable?  Prayer does make a difference.

Pray for:
- The sick, untouchable and isolated
- Those mourning
- The starving and desperate
- Those surrounded by fear and terror
- Those deceived by hatred and bitterness

Secondly, ask God to help you point others to faith in Him when given the opportunity to share your thoughts on the cure the world needs.  As we continue to encounter dark seasons of the age, may the light we have in Jesus Christ shine in the compelling way it was meant to be known, for our God reigns.

*...The four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp and they were holding golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of God’s people. And they sang a new song, saying:*

*“You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, because you were slain, and with your blood you purchased for God persons from every tribe and language and people and nation. You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth.”
Revelation 5:8-10*
