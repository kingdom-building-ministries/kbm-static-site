RE·MEM·BER (verb): *to recall to the mind by an act or effort of memory; 
to retain in the memory; keep in mind; remain aware of.*

Over and over again throughout Scripture, God calls His people to remember. 

“REMEMBER how the Lord your God led you all the way in the wilderness these forty years.”  (Deut. 8:2)

“REMEMBER that you were slaves in Egypt and the Lord your God redeemed you.”  (Deut. 15:15)

“REMEMBER the wonders he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced.” (1 Chron. 16:12)

With such a strong and persistent call to remember, it would seem that God knew that His people are apt to forget.  

It’s almost comical to read through the Old Testament and witness the Israelites, time after time, forgetting all that God has done for them. It doesn’t take long for them to forget the horrors of Egypt, to forget God’s miraculous rescue, and instead to complain of harsh conditions and wish that they could go back. From our standpoint, thousands of years later when the happy ending of the story is just a matter of turning a few pages, it’s easy to wonder why the Israelites were so quick to lose faith, and how they could ever forget what God had done for them. 

And yet, how often do we act in the same way?  How often do we lose faith when God seems distant or silent, when finances feel like they just won’t stretch, or our job is unsteady, or our relationships are insecure. How often do we cry out to God, asking Him along with the Israelites if He led us into a desert to die?

We wonder if God really knows what He’s doing – and all the while He is calling us: “Will you trust me a little more?  Will you remember what I have done in the past ... and trust me a little more?”

How has God shown up for you in your life? If you are struggling to see Him or hear Him currently, take some time now to remember – and believe that He is the same, yesterday, today, and forever.
