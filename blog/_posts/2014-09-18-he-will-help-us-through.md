"Look to the Lord and his strength; seek his face always." (1 Chronicles 16:11)

Praise be to God for His unstoppable grace and love that can break through anything and call for our attention and devotion.

This week, God spoke to my heart right in the middle of a TV show...

The main character, in danger and without a husband, doctor or hospital, is found going into labor and has no choice but to deliver her baby with only her father by her side.  "This isn't how I wanted this to go," she cries.  Her pain, her anxiety about the baby's health, her loneliness and her fear overtakes her like a storm and helplessness paralyzes her.  But for the baby to survive, it must be delivered in that moment.  Her father, taking in the necessity to intervene, grips her hand and commands her attention: 

**"LOOK AT ME!"**  

That instant, as her eyes meet his, she begins to focus and follow his every word until her newborn daughter rests safely in her arms.

My heart stirred as the show faded into the background and I heard the echo of our Heavenly Father, "Look at me!  Focus on me and follow my lead."

What challenges are you facing right now?  May the voice of our Heavenly Father steady you today as you hear Him say:  Look to me and my strength; seek my face always.
