It’s that time of year - back to school, work, sports, leagues, church groups and more.  The shuffle of new friends, old friends, familiar places and unknown places brings excitement...and often insecurity in one way or another.  Maybe you’ve sensed this question linger in the air through meetings, in the classroom, at the kitchen table, or have seen it written on the ceiling as you lay in bed...*Am I enough?*  

Identity.  We question it, worry about it, and make tiring efforts to improve it.  Can you imagine the freedom that would come if our questions about ourselves stopped?  Get this, identity was something Adam and Eve didn’t question, perhaps didn’t even think about, in the garden before the serpent came.  They belonged to God, they knew what to do, and complete joy, love, peace and rest was theirs with God.  One day, we too will be face to face with God.  But The Fall did happen, relationship was broken and identity became twisted around us.  *Am I enough?* is, in fact the wrong question.  

A resource we recommend, one that God has used to transform my own heart, is a book entitled, *The Freedom of Self-Forgetfulness*, by Timothy Keller.  The book explains a pestering roadblock that prevents us from experiencing the freedom, grace and identity, which is ours through Jesus Christ – our ego.  He also paints a picture for a life defined not by false humility, but by genuine gospel-centered humility – thinking of ourselves less.  The booklet is available online at <a href="http://www.christianbook.com/the-freedom-of-self-forgetfulness/timothy-keller/9781906173418/pd/173418?product_redirect=1&Ntt=173418&item_code=&Ntk=keywords&event=ESRCP" target="_blank">Christianbooks.com</a>. 

What would change in your life if instead of asking, *Am I Enough?*, you let Jesus Christ be enough?  There is a way to walk in more freedom today.  

**Are you tired yet?  Ego Explained:**

**Empty**: The normal human ego is built on something else besides God.  Spiritual pride is the illusion that we are competent to run our own lives, achieve our own sense of self-worth and find a purpose big enough to give us meaning in life without God.

**Painful**: My ego would not hurt unless there was something wrong with it.  Our feelings are fine — it is our ego (my sense of self and my identity) that stings.

**Busy**: My ego is always drawing attention to itself in hopes of filling its emptiness, most often through comparing and boasting.

**Fragile**: Like an overinflated balloon, we are in imminent danger of being deflated.
