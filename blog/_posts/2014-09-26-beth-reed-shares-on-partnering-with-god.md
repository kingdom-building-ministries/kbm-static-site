>“When you’re invested for the long haul, committed over time to what God is up to, in a relationship or ministry, you will see different kinds of return on your investment ... things only God could do.”

Have you ever wondered what partnering with God looks like, real-time and on the ground?  Be encouraged by this interview with our Board Chair, Beth Reed.

**Q: How have you learned to partner with God in the work He’s up to?**

**A:** I remember asking my Dad this same question when I was a young adult, only married a few years.  Growing up I had watched my father and mother join God in His work and that powerfully shaped my life.  “How do you know,” I asked, “how do you live, give and offer strategically for kingdom work?”

In short, look for “heart matches” and “heart tugs”!  

Over time I have learned that God brings people across my path that I seem to have a “heart match” with; the person’s ministry and what they’re doing for the Kingdom really tugs on my heart strings.  For example, I’ll hear about a need (from a local church, missionary, etc.) and something resonates deep within me – it’s as if God’s spirit is moving me to join in and get excited!

God delights in us experiencing the joy of partnering with Him.  I think because of that, God uses our interests, gifting, desires and heartbeat to lead us towards things He wants to accomplish.  My husband Jim has been amazed at the way God has even employed his passion for mechanics and tractors for Kingdom advancement!

Psalm 37:4 says, “Take delight in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart.”  The way I see it, as I delight in the Lord I see how the desires placed in me will often match the Kingdom work He leads me to do.  The cycle of delight is then complete when I get to join Him where He’s working by offering who I am! 

Finally, it’s much easier to join God when we are actively looking.  I truly believe that God brings people near us who have needs that He has enabled us to meet ... God appointments or divine appointments.  God does not keep His work a cosmic secret – He shows up in our natural and everyday relationships.

**Q: What keeps you giving your time, energy and resources?**

**A:** It’s the joy we receive from giving.  Scripture says that it’s better to give than to receive (Acts 20:35).  When we partner with God in investing our lives, time and resources, we do receive!  Over the years, Jim and I have taken great joy in the deep relationships that form and in watching God turn our investments (whether time, talent, service or resources) into miraculous returns for His Kingdom.

**Q: What encouragement would you offer to others looking to partner with God more?** 

**A:** Have a posture in your heart and mind of alertness.  Be aware of who God is bringing across your path and projects or needs you hear of that resonate with your heart and with the desires God has placed within you.  The Holy Spirit may be preparing you for something He wants you to join in.  As those opportunities come, step out in faith and out of your comfort zone!  Give, offer and help while trusting God to supply and provide.  When you feel stretched beyond what you think you can offer, God is setting you up to experience multiplied joy…joy that comes from depending on God and seeing His faithfulness.

Also, be committed for the long haul when possible.  There is great excitement in seeing the story God is writing unfold over time.  Focus on 1-3 things instead of spreading yourself thin over many opportunities.

For ten years, Jim and I have traveled to the Czech Republic to teach English.  But the very first time we went, I had no idea what to expect and had never even taught English before!  But I had so much fun stepping into something new, even though I had felt scared about it.  God came alongside and provided all that I needed.  So far we have traveled back nine times!  Through our commitment over time, God has nurtured a special trust in the relationships that have formed and we see Him working in even greater ways now.  

**Q: Describe the kind of legacy a lifestyle of partnering with God can leave.**

**A:** My parents modeled this lifestyle by having missionaries stay in our home.  As a child I got to meet people from other countries and hear what God was doing through them.  This impacted my life so significantly that when Jim and I established our home, we did the same!  Our children grew up getting to hear what God was doing all around the world.

One night as our daughter considered what she wanted to do when she got older, she told us, “I want to do what you and mom do…I love how you always have people over and open your hearts and home to others.”  It was so humbling to hear our daughter, at 16, express her desire to continue the legacy of partnering with God.  Today, our hearts overflow with joy in watching both our son and daughter do family life in a way that welcomes the plans God has in mind.

Those around us are taking note!  If you’re a parent right now, your greatest investment and highest calling is in your children for this season.  Partner with God in shaping their lives and modeling a heart and lifestyle of generosity and giving (time, talents and resources)…you will never be able to measure the Kingdom impact your investment in them will have.

**In whatever season or place in life you find yourself, God invites you to join Him! A lifestyle of partnering *with Him*, daily, is full of joy and will leave a legacy of Kingdom impact for generations to come.**
