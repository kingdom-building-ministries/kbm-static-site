Have you ever noticed how some people, although they have been around the things of God most of their life, seem much more passionate and committed to things like sports teams, family happenings, and financial investments than they are their relationship with God and what’s happening in his Kingdom?  Why are some so quick to broadcast where to save money at the pump, or post the latest family selfie on Facebook, or play armchair quarterback the day after the game; yet, when it comes to the deeper things of faith and life, they seemed tight-lipped and distant from the very things they say they believe?  Could it be that when it comes right down to it such people actually show their hand as to what they genuinely value in life?

“Where your treasure is”...*what you value*, Jesus said, “there your heart will be also”...*what you love*.  (Matthew 6:21)   How we spend our time, where our money and resources go, what we are passionate about, who or what consumes our thoughts, how we invest in others, where we devote our best energy and talents, what we are willing to sacrifice and suffer for, and where our true loyalties lie, all point to what we genuinely value in our lives. 

This truth is perhaps nowhere more evident than in our relationship with God.  A heart deep-rooted with the values of God’s Kingdom produces a life of authentic Kingdom fruit and love.  Where Kingdom values are planted and nurtured, the Kingdom life takes root and makes its way to the surface of everyday life.  Simply put, what we genuinely value, we genuinely live.  So, the person who values loving God intimately gradually demonstrates a life that loves like he or she has been spending deep and abiding time with God.  The person who values seeking first and foremost God’s Kingdom and his agenda, more and more puts his or her life in proper perspective and steadily aligns his or her choices of time, resources, and talents in ways that shows that the Kingdom of God really does come first.  The person who values being led daily by the Holy Spirit and practices such shows evidence of one who walks lockstep with God’s movement and direction and willingly listens *for* and *to* God’s voice in every situation, conversation, and encounter.

Kingdom Laborers seek to make what’s important to God important to them.  That’s why Kingdom values are so important to Christ-followers.  Far too long, well-meaning people have sought to love God and others through a change of behavior (religious activity) without ever allowing God to penetrate and cultivate their heart behavior (a heart cultured by Kingdom values).  Changes in behavior produce religious people.  God, however, sent Jesus to make loving people.  Behavioral changes might make us good, but living out Kingdom values gives us life.  And we were created to live!  Jesus said, “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.”  (John 10:10)  Lives that flow out of a Kingdom-cultured heart live life to its fullest extent.
Loving God and aligning our true heart values with his is the source and seedbed for a life that loves as God loves, says what God says, and does what God does.   And as we grow, our stated values find a truer consistency in the everyday spaces and places of life.
