*"...but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed.  Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death" (James 1:14-15).*

Sin has an insatiable appetite and can devour you.  Scripture is clear, light and darkness cannot co-exist.  Are you stuck in a cycle of bondage?  A pattern of sin that seems normal now?  There is an exit out of the cycle: life, through freedom in Jesus Christ.  Watch this message from <a href="http://www.kbm.org/speakers/chris-emery/" target="_blank">Chris Emery</a>, and while you do, ask Jesus how you can step more fully into a life redeemed by the gospel today.
