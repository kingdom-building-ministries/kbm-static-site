One day we will gather in heaven with every tribe, tongue and nation!  Once such tribe on God's heart is the Hadzabe, whom Charlie and Nathan depart this Tuesday to spend over 2 months with in Tanzania. 

Charlie and Nathan plan to share the Gospel through a picture banner (shown in the video) and through recording oral translations of Bible stories on solar-powered devices that can be easily shared with others.  Please watch the video below to hear them share the vision God has placed on their hearts -- making disciples who will make disciples -- and PRAY!

>One day we'll come to a village and ask a man, "Who do you worship?".  And he won't say the sun as I've heard in the past, but he'll say "I worship Jesus Christ!".  Then I'll ask, "How did you hear about Him?"  His reply, "Another Hadzabe man told me."

Please join us in praying for new followers of Jesus Christ to be raised up in Tanzania as they hear about and believe in the Way, the Truth and the Life!
