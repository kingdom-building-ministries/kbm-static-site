Come home to Jesus today.  There is always an open invitation into His heart.

"Today the heart of God is an open wound of love. He aches over our distance and preoccupation. He mourns that we do not draw near to him. He grieves that we have forgotten him. He weeps over our obsession with muchness and manyness. He longs for our presence. And he is inviting you—and me—to come home, to come home to where we belong, to come home to that for which we were created. His arms are stretched out wide to receive us. His heart is enlarged to take us in. For too long we have been in a far country: a country of noise and hurry and crowds, a country of climb and push and shove, a country of frustration and fear and intimidation. And he welcomes us home; home to serenity and peace and joy, home to friendship and fellowship and openness, home to intimacy and acceptance and affirmation...The key to this home, this heart of God, is prayer...If the key is prayer, the door is Jesus Christ. How good of God to provide us a way into his heart...We may now enter through the door of God’s grace and mercy in Jesus Christ."
