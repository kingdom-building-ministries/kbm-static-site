*Go with the strength you have.* (Judges 6:14) 

Taking place this week is the second of a series of youth leader conferences in Haiti!  Our staff has had the privilege to join in the efforts of encouraging and equipping these young Haitian leaders to live passionately for Christ and to gain vision for how to point those in their youth groups and churches to grow an intimate and vibrant relationship with God.  Among those present from our staff are Adrian Despres, Rob Cupp, Rachel and Colin Reed, Nate Hoot, Laura Bulgrien, and Garrett Kahrs (a 2014 Experience alumni).

One exciting tool each conference participant has received is the Spiritual Life Notebook translated in Creole (pictured below)!  Three were given to each youth leader, one for their use and two to equip others with.

As the conference opened, the group was challenged to make Jesus their one and only – a commitment that is to be carefully weighed and not taken lightly. In the next session, they were encouraged to fix their gaze on God, not on themselves or their circumstances and other distractions, and to depend on God's strength to be the mighty warriors He has called them to be.  Sunday evening, they spent time listening to God's voice and wrote down what was spoken so they might remember the encouragement and direction God shared.

God is definitely on the move in hearts and lives, and He has also been on the move through smiles and laughter!  Team-building activities and games in the afternoons have provided breakthrough in relationships and connection between our teams and the Haitian youth leaders.  When you can't speak the same language, sometimes laughter provides the bridge you need!

Adrian Despres spoke Monday evening, and the youth leaders responded well to his teaching on passion.  Many of them stood, one-by-one, to proclaim, "I love Jesus and I want to be passionate for Him!"  Tuesday night he shared on sin and God's grace. 

In the midst of the exciting advances being made for God’s Kingdom, a strong spiritual battle is present, but we believe the victory is God’s!  Adrian recently shared with the team that in order to experience revival, there must be spiritual breakthrough.  Please pray to that end. 

**Prayer Requests:**
- For the transforming work of the Holy Spirit to change hearts and lives
- For the youth leaders to receive God-inspired vision 
- That bondage to legalism or religion will be broken so that people will be free to experience the amazing grace found in Jesus 
- For God to bridge cultural barriers and to work through the language barrier
- Energy for the staff team and participants
- Eyes to see with God's eyes
