Kingdom Building Ministries is coming to your area on the <a href="http://myemail.constantcontact.com/Join-us-on-the-Forge-Forward-Tour.html?soid=1110408784002&aid=saPZ2HDnQT0" target="_blank">Forge Forward Tour</a>! We invite you to join us for this incredible opportunity to re-ignite your relationship with God and re-fuel your passion for building His Kingdom.

Many of you support and pray for this ministry from a distance, and the Forge Forward Tour is a timely opportunity to experience (once again or for the first time) the fullness of KBM's ministry up-close!

This event will also be a great chance to bring your friends, family, ministry co-workers and potential KBM students up-close to the ministry that has deeply impacted your own life.
 
*What can you expect to experience at the Forge Forward Tour?*
- Time before each event to reconnect with KBM speakers, staff and alumni
- Hear challenging messages from various KBM Speakers
- Learn about opportunities to bring KBM speakers to your schools and churches
- The chance to book a KBM speaker for free at your next event

We can't wait to see you! Registration is free, but seating is limited. 

Reserve your seat today @ <a href="http://www.kbm.org/tour/" target="_blank">kbm.org/tour</a>.
