I sat across the table from my sister, staring into my ice cream bowl and waiting for her response. I had just told her about feeling like I was supposed to go spend a summer in Africa, and if I’m honest with myself I was probably half hoping she would talk me out of it. It felt like a crazy, irrational and irresponsible idea, but it had been swirling around in my head until I could no longer carry it alone, so I shared it with the one I’ve shared everything with for my whole life. Not only did she not talk me out of it: she told me to go for it.  

“You’re not crazy,” she said. “I think it’s a great idea.”

So I left a couple of months later. The time I spent in Africa was incredible beyond my wildest dreams. I encountered God in new ways, I began to learn how to listen for His voice and follow His lead, and I gained confidence in teaching others. That summer changed my life.

The following year I had another crisis moment. I was afraid that I had chosen the wrong major to study in college and was afraid that because of this choice I had somehow messed up my whole future. I laid in my bed with anxious tears streaming down my cheeks until my sister climbed down from her top bunk, laid down right next to me, and asked what was wrong.  As I shared with her, I was again surprised by her lack of surprise or worry. She simply said, “Remember what you know about the way God speaks. He won’t lead you through panic – that’s not what His voice sounds like.”  And somehow, that simple sentence brought peace back to my previously shattered mind.  That simple sentence has stuck with me in all the years since.

I am where I am today, working in full-time ministry and investing in the lives of others, in part because of the faithfulness of one person who didn’t have an official ministry title, but who encouraged me, sharpened me and called me to deeper places in my walk with Jesus.

As I think through my life, I find that many of the most impactful moments I have known came in similarly small settings, face-to-face with someone who cared about me and wanted to invest in my life. Sitting across from someone at a coffee shop, next to a friend on an airplane, or on a long car ride. It is usually informal, it is usually very personal, and it is usually from someone who doesn’t know all the answers but who has taken the time to get to know my heart.

Jesus said, “The harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few” (Matthew 9:37). And after He rose from the dead He said, “As the Father has sent me, I am sending you!” (John 20:21). And still we try to disqualify ourselves for the task He left us with, to “go and make disciples of all nations” (Matthew 28:19). We think that surely that call is for someone else – someone who knows more, or who has a greater platform, or who is a better leader.

Take a moment now to write down the names of the people who have been most impactful in your life. 

Are they all gifted up-front speakers? Great leaders? Scholars and philosophers? 
Or are they your friends, your family members, people who chose to value knowing your heart more than they value knowing all the answers? 

If they could have that kind of Kingdom impact on your life, what kind of impact might you be able to have on someone else’s life?  

Ask the Lord if there is someone He wants you to invest in more deeply. Then invite that person over to your house, go out for coffee, or find a hobby that you both enjoy doing together.  As you do this, you just might find yourself swept up in His great plan to change the world – one life at a time.
