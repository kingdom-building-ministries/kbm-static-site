    We hope you are inspired and encouraged!<br>
    <br>
    At <a href="/training">kbm.org/training</a> you will find upcoming opportunities for you, your family and friends to join other kingdom laborers committed to discovering deeper intimacy with God.<br>
    <br>
    This Labor Day weekend, take a moment, draw near to God and ask Him what difference-making opportunities He may be calling you to in this next year.  As we celebrate the hard work being done for God's Kingdom across the world, let us be reminded that it all begins with an intimate relationship with God.  Your choice to make Him your number one pursuit will make a difference in your family, community, the world and generations to come.<br>
    <br>
    You are believed in, purposed, known and loved by the King.  <br>
    <br>
    Happy LaborER Day from all of us at Kingdom Building Ministries!<br>
