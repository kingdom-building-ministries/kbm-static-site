                <h1><em>What</em> is 16 Days?</h1><strong><em>16 Days</em></strong> is physically, emotionally, and spiritually intense discipleship training designed to both challenge and equip high school students to a life redefined by radical and intentional devotion to God! This practical, hands-on adventure is packed with action and suspense that will keep students on their toes. They will be immersed in outdoor, rural, urban, and classroom settings–different from their normal everyday lives–in order to encounter God alive in the people and world around them. Some of the darkest places in the world are modern day high schools. What if students were equipped to boldly live out and intentionally advance the Kingdom of God in the un-reached places around them?! Through <a href="http://www.kbm.org/5-components-of-kbm-training">classroom teaching, one-on-one coaching, and experiential training</a> students will leave equipped with life skills that will help them live passionately for Christ, impact the world around them with His love and truth, and dig deep into discovering God's uniquely designed plan for their life!

                    In the <strong>Intensive Discipleship Phase</strong>, students will experience through “hands-on adventure” what it means to practically live out a life of surrender to God. The student team will be challenged through intense outdoor adventure experiences, teaching from Kingdom Building Ministries' staff, intercultural ministry, grueling team building, on-on-one coaching and more. <em><strong>16 Days</strong></em> concludes back at the Kingdom Building Ministries headquarters in Denver, CO for student debriefing and practical application training designed to empower students to carry their experiences back into real life.

                    In the <strong>Ministry and Support Phase</strong>, students will return home and begin applying what they've learned in their “real world”, everyday environment where God has placed them. Their assigned spiritual coach will come along side them for an additional 24 weeks, encouraging them, praying for them, and providing accountability as they reenter life at home with greater purpose, greater intentionality, and greater surrender.
