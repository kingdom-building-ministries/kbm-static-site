          <h1><em>What</em> will we be doing?</h1>The Experience is based on Kingdom Building Ministries’ philosophy of training. So, everything you will be doing is designed to challenge you to live rest of your life with a “heart on fire” for God and equip you to live a lifestyle of active ministry regardless of your professional career path.<br>
          <br>
          So, we can tell you that it will be INTENSE. You will experience a ton of things in a short 57 days. Throughout The Experience you’ll encounter KBM’s <a href="/training/components">five components of training</a>. You’ll have a personal coach that will walk with you through the whole program. You’ll learn from KBM’s high-impact speakers in classroom settings. You’ll learn specific skills that will help you to be a blessing to others throughout your entire life. You will be given opportunities to DO what you’re being taught and learn as you’re DOING. You will be learning how to live in unity with the individuals from the rest of this summer’s Experience team. The year-long program is divided into 6 different stages.<br>

          <h3>The <em>Denver</em> Stage: </h3><br>
          This stage involves a series of classroom teaching at KBM’s Headquarters in Aurora, CO. During that time, you’ll begin a one-on-one relationship with a coach who will pray, help, encourage, and keep you accountable throughout the next year. You’ll be challenged by powerful messages from KBM speakers, equipped through practical skill workshops and individual sessions with a coach who loves you. And you’ll engage various ministry experiences that will help you to begin practicing a paradigm-shifting lifestyle of ministry.

          <h3>The <em>International</em> Stage: </h3>In this stage, you will grow in your understanding of God’s heart for the nations as you experience multiple cultures in an international context. Locations may include the Dominican Republic & Haiti or Honduras & Guatemala. Classroom teaching will also be part of this stage, but cross-cultural ministry experiences will incorporate the majority of the learning environment.

          <h3>The <em>Wander</em> Stage: </h3>
          This stage is uniquely designed to be a mystery. All we can tell you is that you will be “wandering” on the ultimate amazing race-style, multi-state road trip that will be filled with many ministry opportunities and learning experiences. It is designed to stretch your faith, keep you guessing, and help you see the world through a different set of eyes.

          <h3>The <em>Dreaming and Planning</em> Stage: </h3>The last seven days of the intensive training portion of the program is all about YOU! Back at KBM’s Headquarters in Aurora, CO, we will look at all the experiences you’ve had, all the lessons you have learned, all of the skills you’ve acquired and begin to dream and plan about how God will use you to reach your world for Christ. You will be inspired and encouraged by what you discover God wants to do through YOU! And at the end of the week, you’ll be holding a ministry and life plan that fits you like a glove.

          <h3>The <em>Ministry and Support</em> Stage: </h3>The entire program is focused on preparing you for the moment you return home on July 15th. Will you be prepared to live the life God created you for and engage a lifetime of God-glorifying, self-denying, real-world impacting ministry? In this stage, we’ll be meeting by phone on monthly conference calls as a team. How’s it going? How can we pray for one another, encourage one another and learn from what God is teaching us? Also, you will continue to be coached from a distance by your assigned coach. They’ll provide encouragement and accountability as you seek to live out the life and the plan God reveals for you.
