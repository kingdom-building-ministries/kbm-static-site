                    <h1><em>Mick</em> Veach</h1><span style="color:#cb222f;"><strong>Mick</strong></span> Veach was saved at the age of 15 at a youth camp and the journey began from there. He began to pursue God with all of his heart and found that this was what he had been looking for. His passion to share the love of God with the lost has propelled him to serve to the ends of the earth. His endeavors have led him from smuggling Bibles to China to feeding lepers in India. He has shared the gospel in over 60 countries.

                <!-- <p>He and his wife Melanie began a church planting effort in an Islamic unreached people group and today the result is over 125 believers meeting illegally in homes and lifting up the name of Jesus. He recruited and helped opened up 4 new fields in that area of the world.</p> -->

                <p>Mick’s passion for God is contagious and is evident as he communicates. He loves to connect with young people from camps to university settings. His experience is well served in mission conferences or spiritual formation venues.</p>

                <p>He has served as a Youth Pastor, Church Planter and Area Director for Central Asia and the Middle East for Global Partners. Mick is currently Senior Pastor at Stoney Creek Community Church in Washington, MI.</p>

                <p>Mick and Melanie have been married since 1992 and have three children, Mickey, Michalla and Morgan, who they find to be the delight of their lives.</p>

                <p>Mick’s passion is to finish the great commission and to mobilize as many people as possible to engage in this effort. His life verse is Acts 20:24, “However, I consider my life worth nothing to me if only I can finish the race and complete the task the task the Lord Jesus has given me, the task of testifying to the gospel of God’s grace.”</p>
