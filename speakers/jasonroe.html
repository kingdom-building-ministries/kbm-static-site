          <p><span style="color:#cb222f;"><strong>Jason's</strong></span> ministry started in youth ministry in 1994. As a youth pastor, he received invitations to preach revivals, retreats, and conferences. In 1997, Jason went on staff at Seymour United Methodist Church as their Minister of Youth and Education. As his gifts developed, the congregation at Seymour confirmed his call to Evangelism and opened the door Jason to enter into full time evangelism. He received an Associates of Science degree from Hiwassee College in Madisonville, Tennessee, a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and a Masters of Divinity from Asbury Seminary. Today, Jason is serving as a General Evangelist for the Holston Conference of the Methodist Church.</p>
  
          <p><span style="color:#cb222f;"><strong>Jason</strong></span> is blessed with a wonderful Christian wife, Holly, who is a partner in his ministry through her gifts of music. They are parents of two great kids, Madison and Grayson. They are dedicated to the lifelong mission of spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ throughout the world.</p>
