                    <h1><em>Tim</em> Reilly</h1><span style="color:#cb222f;"><strong>Tim</strong></span> was an antagonistic atheist growing up after his mom died of cancer when he was 8 years old. After debating and arguing many Christians out of their faith, God got a hold of Tim through his intellect first; based on the evidence of the Resurrection. Then he had a radical experience on 6/13/01, in a church of all places. Tim was very successful in the insurance industry for over a decade, but throughout that time God had been growing and preparing Tim to be a full time minister of the Gospel.

Tim is passionate about letting people of all ages know that they do not have to check their minds at the door to trust and follow Jesus.<br>
