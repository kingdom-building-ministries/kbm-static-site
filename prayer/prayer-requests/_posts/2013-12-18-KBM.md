*But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well.  Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom. ... Be dressed and ready for service and keep your lamps burning, like men waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him.  Luke 12:31-32, 35-36*

Please pray that what was learned this summer would continue to move from heads to hearts and that seeking the Kingdom would be the number one priority.  We believe, through Kingdom laborers, that more families, communities and schools will begin to evidence the touch that the Kingdom of Heaven has come near.  Let's continue to labor in prayer for more of God, more of His will and more of His glory.
