When was the last time you thanked someone for telling you "no"?

When we do not get what we want, gratitude is not typically our response.  We do not like to be refused.  And yet sometimes our deepest, most desperate prayers feel like they are met with just that answer: "No".  We struggle, and we wrestle, and we try to make God see things from our perspective. 

Maybe we eventually come to understand the necessity of being told "no" if what we desire is not truly beneficial or healthy or glorifying to God.  But sometimes what we ask for is a genuinely good thing, and we can't imagine what possible reason He would have for denying our request.
 
But maybe a "good" thing is still not the "best" thing.  What would change in our lives if our highest aim, our greatest desire, our only goal, was for nothing less than to know God more and have more of His heart and His will manifested in our lives?

Could we dare to pray this prayer?

"Holy Lord...

I thank Thee that many of my prayers have been refused.  I have asked amiss and do not have, I have prayed from lusts and been rejected, I have longed for Egypt and been given a wilderness.  Go on with Thy patient work, answering 'no' to my wrongful prayers, and fitting me to accept it.  Purge me from every false desire, every base aspiration, everything contrary to Thy rule.  I thank Thee for Thy wisdom and Thy love, for all the acts of discipline to which I am subject, for sometimes putting me into the furnace to refine my gold and remove my dross...

If Thou shouldst give me choice to live in pleasure and keep my sins, or to have them burnt away with trial, give me sanctified affliction.  **Deliver me from...everything that dims the brightness of Thy grace in me**..."
