This week, find time for stillness, silence and a quiet heart, that you may experience the divine whisper of our wonderful Lord within your soul.  Let the prayer below begin your time:

*Teach me to stop and listen,
Teach me to center down.
Teach me the use of silence,
Teach me where peace is found.*

*Teach me to hear Your calling,
Teach me to search Your Word.
Teach me to hear in silence,
Things I have never heard.*

*Teach me to be collected,
Teach me to be in tune,
Teach me to be directed,
Silence will end so soon.*

*Then when it's time for moving,
Grant it that I might bring,
To every day and moment,
Peace from a silent spring.*

(By Ken Medema, found in *Sanctuary of the Soul* by Richard Foster)
