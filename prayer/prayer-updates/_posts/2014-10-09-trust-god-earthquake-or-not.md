*"... being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus" (Philippians 1:6).*

Do you believe God truly is leading your life?  Life has a way of weaving in and out of seasons of clarity, uncertainty, joy and hardship.  But through it all, have you been resting in the truth of God's promise over your life?  That He will carry His good work in you to completion?

We pick up this letter in Philippians from Paul, imprisoned, and writing to a beloved group of people back in Philippi where he had founded their church eleven years prior.  For a deeper connection to the story, those in Philippi would probably recall the time when Paul and Silas were delivered from their prison cell by a God-sent earthquake (Acts 16:16-34).  What encouragement this church must have found from Paul's letter as they themselves are now facing persecution.  It's possible that they wondered if God would come through with an earthquake again, for them, or for Paul.  Possibly so, God could certainly change it all.  But if not, what else might He be up to?

Paul, imprisoned again, facing possible execution and not counting on a break-through earthquake, finds a way to be filled with joy, assurance, faith and love (read Philippians 1)!  How?  Just as Paul believed God would carry His good work to completion for those in Philippi, he believed the promise for himself.  Come earthquake and freedom, or not, Paul lived his life for "the glory and praise of God" (Philippians 1:11) and believed God always had His good and perfect plans in place.  Through this assurance and trust, Paul was filled with thanksgiving and joy.  May the same be said of us as our trust in Jesus Christ deepens.

This week in prayer, find time to relinquish your doubts and questions over to God.  Earthquake or not, God is up to something good in and through your life as you seek Him wholeheartedly ... trust His leading.
