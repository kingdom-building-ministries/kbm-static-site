Thank you for your prayers during the "Equip Haiti" Youth Conference!  We are rejoicing over all God has done and cannot wait to see how His Kingdom will grow and spread as these leaders return back to their home communities with new vision and passion to share the Gospel and disciple others.  To read more about the conference, visit our blog @ <a href="http://www.kbm.org/blog/" target="_blank">kbm.org/blog</a>.  
 
*After being ushered before the throne of heaven day after day, the conference ended with a powerful message proclaiming the true strength we have to go forward with: CHRIST in us, the hope of glory.* 

*Christ is in you ... Christ is in you ... Christ is in you.*
 
*This phrase was repeated as we walked around the auditorium, coming up close to each one, touching one another and saying with all the confidence of God's promise that Christ is in us and will be with us.

We praise God that more kingdom laborers are being equipped to serve the King! But don't forget, YOU are called also, and God has glorious plans in store this week that involve your help.  Will you, like those at the conference, go forward this week believing you have the strength you need?  

**Christ is in you, the hope of glory!**
