"The end of all things is near.  Therefore be clear minded and self-controlled so that you can pray." (1 Peter 4:7)

We often forget the subtleties our adversary uses to draw us away from keeping the "main things" the "main things" in our lives.  Distractions, curve balls, surprises, and those no-good-rotten days have a way of steering us far off course. I don't believe we can control life to the extent that distractions and surprises disappear, but I believe what Peter is encouraging us towards is to turn our hearts to God and remain centered with eternal perspective when life's interruptions come.  Life is short, our distractions are many, and enthroned in heaven is a God who is not surprised, and who is always bringing His good and perfect plans about.  What prayer assignments or Kingdom advancing opportunities might be revealed if we would remember to stay near to God, depend on His guidance and pray?

Take a moment and reflect on your past week... 
What kinds of distractions or surprises did you encounter?  Were you prayerful through them, maintaining self-control?  Or were you led off course?  
 
What has God revealed to you from the challenge in 1 Peter 4:7?  How can you incorporate a steady posture of prayer and conversation with God this week?
