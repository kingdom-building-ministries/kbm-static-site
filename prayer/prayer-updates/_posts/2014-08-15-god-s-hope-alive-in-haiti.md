The impossible becomes possible within God's perfect plan of redemption.  As our staff team has gathered in prayer lately, we have been full of praise for the ways God is strategically opening doors of opportunity for His Good News in places the world has deemed hopeless and impossible.  Most persecuted, most dangerous, most poor, most atheistic...don't those sound like just the types of places God might be writing a new story in?
 
One such opportunity of hope and possibility is happening within Haiti.  This week, a team of our staff members are traveling to there to join with youth leaders and pastors from around the nation for the second of a series of youth equipping conferences.  Through these conferences, young adult leaders are being released into a life of Kingdom laborership and mobilized to start discipleship movements in their communities!  God only knows the transformation that is to come within the nation through the devotion and desire of these young adults to wholeheartedly seek God.
 
Please be interceding on behalf of the nation of Haiti this week, and please keep our staff covered in prayer as they depend upon God's wisdom to teach and equip these young leaders.

*No one's ever seen or heard anything like this, never so much as imagined anything quite like it -- what God has arranged for those who love him. (1 Corinthians 2:9 Message)*
