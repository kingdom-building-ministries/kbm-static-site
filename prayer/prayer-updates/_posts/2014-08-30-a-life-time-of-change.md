"If our daily goal was to be closer to God, how would our lives (family, work, activities, free time) be transformed?"
 
The question above was posed by 2009 Experience alumna, Jess Lyons, to the team of our most recent summer graduates.  As I examined my own life by the question, I realized the possibility for change would be endless.
 
With Jesus as Lord over all, a life-time of change is normal!
 
When we make Jesus our constant companion, we realize He is in everything and we find rest in seeking Him.  Prayer is a natural occurrence as we walk and talk with Him.  Dwelling with Him will guide what we see, hear and do.  His transforming presence will shape the way we confess, what we thank Him for and what we request of Him.  
  
If you've noticed your life and your prayers have become fairly self-focused and static lately, pause and ask God:

*"How would my life be transformed if seeking you was my number one goal?"*
