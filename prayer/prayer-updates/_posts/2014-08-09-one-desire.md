Gathered around our staff prayer table this past week, Pastor David Robertson left us with a powerful reminder as we ended our time together:

"More important than what we do for God is what we do *with* God."

There's a reason why God is to be our one desire.  Our intimacy with God is what makes our today and tomorrow matter.  Our intimacy with God is what makes the ordinary extraordinary.  *God in us* awakens our lives to be about His kingdom, an unfolding story that is much bigger than ourselves.

"I will bring him near and he will come close to me, for who is he who will devote himself to be close to me?" declares the Lord. (Jeremiah 30:21b)

*God in you* ... it's the gift you have to offer the world.  It's why your neighbor wants to hug you not once, but twice.  It's why your co-worker chooses to ask you for advice in the break room.  It's why you're the one thought of when your family member realizes they need help.

"We are therefore Christ's ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us." (Ephesians 5:20)

**Will you make intimacy with God your number one desire this week?**
