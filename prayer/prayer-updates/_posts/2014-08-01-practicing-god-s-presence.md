"Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus" (1 Thessalonians 5:16-18).

With our flesh ruling the emotion of our day, the verse above is perplexing and even frustrating...one we tend to avoid.  How could we rejoice in the midst of bad news?  Why keep praying when there seem to be no answers?  Being thankful for the good things is easy, but what about the challenging circumstances?  Left to our own questions, our perspective is only as high as the top of our heads.

However, with God's Spirit in charge of our heart and mind a different, gospel-focused, perspective is always available.  To the one who wakes up everyday understanding that only the grace-filled, life-transforming, purpose-giving gospel of Jesus Christ holds their life together, joy through all things, prayer through the day, and thanksgiving become a reality.  With some reflection, I wonder if we mistake 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18 for a standard to reach rather than an invitation to be in constant communion with God's very presence.  

If you haven't already read Brother Lawrence's letters collected in *Practicing God's Presence*, we highly recommend it!  Brother Lawrence's life has served as an inspiration to countless lives who have been perplexed by rejoicing always, praying continually and giving thanks in all circumstances.  

Today, if you find yourself resistant to 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18, perhaps you might come before Jesus Christ this week and ask for help.  Are you whole-heartedly surrendered to Him and His plans?  Do you depend on Him?  Have you invited Him to be with you through your entire day?  **May you accept His invitation to a life filled more completely by Him.**

*"For me," he explained, "work time is no different than prayer time.  Even in the noise and clatter of the kitchen, with different people calling for different things all at once, I still know God's presence with just as much real peace as if I were on my knees at communion."  - Brother Lawrence, Practicing God's Presence*
